# AmazonWebScrapper

This project is useful for scrapping the data from a particualr website. 

The main idea of this project to take a website and then parse it according to our needs. 
Once I have the Title and Price of a product, and then check the price every-day.
Therefore it will help me get better deals on the product that I am interested it.

As an added benifit, I have added a small script to send us an email when it goes below particular price.
Thus giving us the opportunity to save money and time at the same time.

This project is the building block fot data-scrapping from webpages and storing them.
